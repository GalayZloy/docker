# AFFiNE Docker

The official Docker deployment solution for AFFiNE.

> This guide assumes you already have an environment setup running docker.

##  Install & Usage

Currently there are two main versions:
* **AFFiNE Alpha** - the latest version in active development `affine-self-hosted:latest`
* **AFFiNE Pre-Alpha** - previous release which is no longer developed, but offers different functionality `affine-self-hosted:pre-alpha`

Simply swap out the Docker image for which version you require, the following instructions default to the latest image.

## Installing AFFiNE using Docker

1. Pull the latest AFFiNE image. This may take some time depending on your network connection.

```
docker pull ghcr.io/toeverything/affine-self-hosted:latest
```

Ensure this step is completed successfully before continuing (you can rerun this command if you are unsure).

2. Next we will run the AFFiNE project in Docker.

```
docker run -it --name affine -d -v YOUR_PATH:/app/data -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/toeverything/affine-self-hosted:latest
```

* `--name` (optional) - this makes it convenient for using and interacting with your Docker container - such as docker restart affine.
* `-v` (optional) - allows you to mount your data outside of Docker to your local machine. Remember to set `YOUR_PATH` to the directory of your choice.
* `-p` (required) - this sets the port for where AFFiNE is running and listening. We use the default `3000`. If you need to change this only change the first number e.g. `YOUR_PORT:3000`
* Finally, the `image id` is the version of AFFiNE you wish to deploy. Following this guide, it would be the same as the previous step - so `ghcr.io/toeverything/affine-self-hosted:latest`

3. You can confirm that AFFiNE is running successfully by using the command
```
docker ps
```

This command shows a list of running containers - in the list you should be able to find AFFiNE.

4. Now you can access AFFiNE from your browser via:

* If you are running Docker on your local machine and using the default settings you can access via port `3000` through localhost: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
* Otherwise you will need to know the `IP` or `domain name` of the machine using Docker and the `PORT` that AFFiNE is using.

> Bear in mind that some features require a secure environment to work, which means `https` and `wss` connections through a reverse proxy setup. If you have any questions or need support you may want to try the **Technical Discussion** space.â€‹
